This repository is made to be a collection of RViz plugins that can be used to work with Avular robots. These plugins can be used to create a unified robot development view, allowing a user to interact with the internals of a robot in a familiar environment.

> Right now, it only contains an Example Panel, which provides a minimal example on how a Panel plugin can be created, and how such a plugin can interact with the ROS ecosystem.
